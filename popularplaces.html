                Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[5] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.[6] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[7] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.the height of the tower is 330mts.</b><br> </p>

It is the tallest tower in Japan since opened in 2012, and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080 ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower,and the third tallest structure in the world (behind Merdeka 118 (678.9 m or 2,227 ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8 m or 2,722 ft)).

                    The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kantō region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012. The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station. The complex is seven kilometres (4.3 miles) northeast of Tokyo Station. Sumida Aquarium is in the Tokyo Solamachi complex.</b></p>

An alleyway of traditional houses lining the street is like time travel. In 1997, amid the movement of urbanization in Seoul, the Asian financial crisis occurred. Under huge financial damage, the Korean government resolved to preserve traditional hanok instead of removing them as old buildings. The movement for the preservation of hanok occurred in 2000. Close to tourist spots such as Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace, Bukchon Hanok Village is an ideal place to learn about Korean traditional architecture and cultures. A poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors, conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, stated that exploring the narrow streets of Bukchon was their fourth favorite activity in Seoul.

                    According to data by the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center, 30,000 people visited the area in 2007. However, after the village was featured in television programmes, such as 2 Days & 1 Night and Personal Taste, the number rose to 318,000 in 2010.[7] Between October 2016 and June 2017, the Tourism Research institute reported that an estimated 37,100 people visited during the week and 54,200 people visited on weekends.</b></p>
